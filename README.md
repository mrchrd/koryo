# koryo

koryo is a full-featured, offline-capable, development platform based on
Kubernetes.

The primary goal of the project is to create a development server that can work
completely offline at a remote area or in a plane. Additionally, it can also be
used as a quickstarter for a team who doesn't have immediate access to all the
tools to start a development project.
